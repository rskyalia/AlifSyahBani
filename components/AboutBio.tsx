          Hello, I’m Alif. With a background in Computer and Network Engineering
          from vocational high school, I am now heading towards a major in
          Computer Engineering. I am eager to further deepen my expertise.
        </p>

        <p>
          My passion lies at the intersection of hard engineering and
          user-centric design. I am deeply enthusiastic about the potential of
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to reshape
          industries. However, I believe that great code needs a great
          interface that is why I dedicate my time to experimenting with modern
          web interfaces and UI/UX design to ensure that complex technologies
          remain accessible and intuitive.
        </p>

        <p>
          My ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between technical innovation and
          real-world application. I don’t just want to write code I want to
          engineer impactful technology products that solve tangible problems
          for society.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I am away from the keyboard, you can find me immersing myself in
          music, exploring new destinations on my bike, or documenting my travel
          and tech journey on social media.
